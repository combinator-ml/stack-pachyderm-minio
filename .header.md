# terraform-k8s-stack-pachyderm-minio

Combinator.ml stack comprising of [Pachyderm](https://github.com/combinator-ml/terraform-k8s-pachyderm) backed by [Minio](https://github.com/combinator-ml/terraform-k8s-minio).

## Usage

This could be used as a module, but it is intended as a self-contained stack.

### Stack Creation

```bash
KUBE_CONFIG_PATH=~/.kube/config terraform apply
```

### Stack Deletion

```bash
KUBE_CONFIG_PATH=~/.kube/config terraform destroy 
```

## Known Issues

- Why do you have to explicitly export the Kubernetes config?

I found that hardcoding the kubeconfig led to [this terraform bug](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks/issues/1234).

- Left over `CertificateSigningRequests`

If you see errors about pods not being able to mouht TLS secrets, it's probably because it's trying to reuse an old set of secrets set up in a previous CertificateSigningRequest. Delete all the old CertificateSigningRequests and try again.

```bash
kubectl delete certificatesigningrequests.certificates.k8s.io minio-tenant-default-csr minio-tenant-console-default-csr
```
